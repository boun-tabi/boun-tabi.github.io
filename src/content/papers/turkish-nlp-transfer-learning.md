## Introduction

Cross-lingual transfer learning has emerged as a promising approach for improving natural language processing (NLP) performance in low-resource languages. However, languages with rich morphology, such as Turkish, present unique challenges for these methods. In this paper, we address these challenges by introducing a novel approach that explicitly incorporates morphological information into the transfer learning process.

## Method

Our approach consists of three main components:

1. A morphological analyzer specifically designed for Turkish
2. A modified pre-training objective that accounts for morphological structures
3. A cross-lingual alignment method that maps between morphologically rich and poor languages

## Results

Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements over previous state-of-the-art methods:

| Task | Previous SOTA | Our Method | Improvement |
|------|---------------|------------|-------------|
| NER  | 78.2%         | 83.5%      | +5.3%       |
| POS  | 92.1%         | 94.7%      | +2.6%       |
| SA   | 76.8%         | 81.2%      | +4.4%       |

## Conclusion

The results demonstrate that explicitly modeling morphological information can substantially improve cross-lingual transfer learning for Turkish NLP tasks. Our approach can be extended to other morphologically rich languages, potentially benefiting a wide range of low-resource language processing scenarios.
