Word embeddings are fixed-length, dense and distributed word representations that are used in natural language processing (NLP) applications. There are basically two types of word embedding models which are non-contextual (static) models and contextual models. The former method generates a single embedding for a word regardless of its context, while the latter method produces distinct embeddings for a word based on the specific contexts in which it appears.

There are plenty of works that compare contextual and non-contextual embedding models within their respective groups in different languages. However, the number of studies that compare the models in these two groups with each other is very few and there is no such study in Turkish. This process necessitates converting contextual embeddings into static embeddings.

## Key Contributions

- **First Comprehensive Study**: First study to compare contextual and non-contextual embeddings for Turkish
- **Static Conversion Methodology**: Novel approach for converting contextual embeddings to static form
- **Fine-grained Analysis**: Separate analysis of syntactic and semantic capabilities
- **Turkish Embedding Repository**: Creation of a comprehensive repository for Turkish word embeddings
- **Evaluation Framework**: Both intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation settings

## Methodology

In this paper, we compare and evaluate the performance of several contextual and non-contextual models in both intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation settings for Turkish. We make a fine-grained comparison by analyzing the syntactic and semantic capabilities of the models separately.

### Evaluation Settings

1. **Intrinsic Evaluation**: Direct assessment of embedding quality through similarity tasks
2. **Extrinsic Evaluation**: Performance on downstream NLP tasks
3. **Syntactic Analysis**: Focus on grammatical relationships and structure
4. **Semantic Analysis**: Evaluation of meaning representation capabilities

## Results and Insights

The results of the analyses provide insights about the suitability of different embedding models in different types of NLP tasks. The study reveals important findings about:

- **Performance Trade-offs**: When static vs. contextual embeddings are more suitable
- **Task-specific Preferences**: Which embedding types work better for specific NLP applications
- **Turkish Language Characteristics**: How morphological richness affects embedding performance
- **Model Selection Guidelines**: Practical recommendations for choosing embedding models

## Resources and Impact

We also build a Turkish word embedding repository comprising the embedding models used in this work, which may serve as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in the field of Turkish NLP. We make the word embeddings, scripts, and evaluation datasets publicly available.

This comprehensive analysis fills a significant gap in Turkish NLP research and provides the community with both empirical insights and practical resources for working with Turkish word embeddings.
