Access to natural language processing resources is essential for their continuous improvement. This can be especially challenging in educational institutions where the software development effort required to package and release research outcomes may be overwhelming and under-recognized. Access to well-prepared and reliable research outcomes is important both for their developers as well as the greater research community.

This paper presents an approach to address this concern with two main goals: (1) to create an open-source easily deployable platform where resources can be easily shared and explored, and (2) to use this platform to publish open-source Turkish NLP resources (datasets and tools) created by a research lab.

## Key Features

- **Easy Deployment**: Open-source platform designed for simple setup and maintenance
- **Interactive Demos**: Supports interactive tool demonstrations for user engagement
- **Containerization**: All tools are containerized to support portability for custom use
- **Resource Sharing**: Centralized platform for sharing datasets and tools
- **Community Access**: Public availability at https://tulap.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/

## Platform Design

The Turkish Natural Language Processing (TULAP) was designed and developed as an easy-to-use platform to share dataset and tool resources which supports interactive tool demos. The platform addresses several key challenges:

1. **Accessibility**: Making research outputs easily accessible to the broader community
2. **Sustainability**: Ensuring long-term availability of research resources
3. **Usability**: Providing interactive interfaces for exploring tools and datasets
4. **Portability**: Supporting custom deployment through containerization

## Resources Available

Numerous open access Turkish NLP resources have been shared on TULAP, including:

- **Datasets**: Various annotated corpora for Turkish NLP tasks
- **Tools**: Processing tools for morphological analysis, parsing, and other NLP tasks
- **Interactive Demos**: Live demonstrations of research tools
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides and usage examples

## Impact and Significance

This work addresses a critical gap in the NLP research ecosystem by providing a sustainable platform for sharing Turkish language resources. The platform serves as a model for other research labs and contributes to the democratization of NLP tools and datasets.

The availability of TULAP has significantly enhanced the accessibility of Turkish NLP resources, fostering collaboration and accelerating research in Turkish language processing. The platform's design principles can be adapted for other languages and research communities, making it a valuable contribution to the broader NLP ecosystem.
