We introduce the resources that we developed for Turkish dependency parsing, which include a novel manually annotated treebank (BOUN Treebank), along with the guidelines we adopted, and a new annotation tool (BoAT). The manual annotation process we employed was shaped and implemented by a team of four linguists and five Natural Language Processing (NLP) specialists.

Decisions regarding the annotation of the BOUN Treebank were made in line with the Universal Dependencies (UD) framework as well as our recent efforts for unifying the Turkish UD treebanks through manual re-annotation. To the best of our knowledge, BOUN Treebank is the largest Turkish treebank. It contains a total of 9,761 sentences from various topics including biographical texts, national newspapers, instructional texts, popular culture articles, and essays.

## Key Contributions

- **Largest Turkish Treebank**: BOUN Treebank with 9,761 manually annotated sentences
- **Diverse Text Sources**: Coverage of biographical texts, newspapers, instructional content, and essays
- **BoAT Annotation Tool**: Custom-built tool for efficient treebank annotation
- **Universal Dependencies Compliance**: Full alignment with UD framework standards
- **Collaborative Approach**: Team effort involving both linguists and NLP specialists

## Methodology

The annotation process involved:

1. **Team Collaboration**: Four linguists and five NLP specialists working together
2. **UD Framework Adherence**: Strict compliance with Universal Dependencies guidelines
3. **Quality Assurance**: Multiple rounds of validation and consistency checking
4. **Tool Development**: Creation of the BoAT (BOUN Annotation Tool) for efficient annotation

## Dataset Characteristics

- **Size**: 9,761 sentences across diverse domains
- **Topics**: Biographical texts, national newspapers, instructional texts, popular culture articles, essays
- **Language**: Turkish (morphologically rich, agglutinative language)
- **Annotation**: Manual dependency parsing following UD standards

## Results and Impact

We report the parsing results of a state-of-the-art dependency parser obtained over the BOUN Treebank as well as two other treebanks in Turkish. Our results demonstrate that the unification of the Turkish annotation scheme and the introduction of a more comprehensive treebank lead to improved performance with regard to dependency parsing.

This work has become a foundational resource for Turkish NLP research, providing the community with high-quality annotated data that supports various downstream tasks including parsing, part-of-speech tagging, and morphological analysis.
