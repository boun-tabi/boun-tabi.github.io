## Course Description

Advanced Natural Language Processing builds upon foundational NLP concepts to explore cutting-edge techniques and architectures that power modern language technologies. Students will gain hands-on experience with transformer-based models, learn about recent advances in large language models, and explore multimodal approaches that combine text with other data types.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:
- Implement and fine-tune transformer-based models for various NLP tasks
- Understand the architecture and capabilities of large language models
- Design and evaluate multimodal learning systems
- Apply advanced techniques to real-world NLP problems
- Critically analyze recent research papers in the field
