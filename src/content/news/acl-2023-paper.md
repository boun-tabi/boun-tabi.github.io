# New Paper Accepted at ACL 2023

We are pleased to announce that our paper titled "Improving Cross-lingual Transfer Learning for Turkish NLP" has been accepted at ACL 2023.

The paper presents a novel approach to improve cross-lingual transfer learning for Turkish natural language processing tasks. We demonstrate significant improvements in performance across multiple NLP tasks including named entity recognition, part-of-speech tagging, and sentiment analysis.

## Paper Abstract

This paper presents a novel approach to improve cross-lingual transfer learning for Turkish natural language processing tasks. We demonstrate significant improvements in performance across multiple NLP tasks including named entity recognition, part-of-speech tagging, and sentiment analysis. Our method leverages morphological information specific to Turkish to enhance the transfer of knowledge from high-resource languages.

## Conference Details

The conference will be held in Toronto, Canada from July 9-14, 2023. Our team members will be presenting the paper on July 11.

If you're attending ACL 2023, we invite you to join our presentation and discuss our work. We'll be sharing more details about the presentation schedule as the conference approaches.
