## Introduction

Turkish dialects present unique challenges for natural language processing due to their morphological complexity and the limited availability of annotated resources. This thesis addresses these challenges by developing novel approaches to morphological analysis that can be applied to low-resource dialectal variants of Turkish.

## Methodology

Our approach combines neural transfer learning techniques with linguistic knowledge about Turkish morphology. We first train models on standard Turkish data, then fine-tune them on small amounts of dialectal data. Additionally, we incorporate linguistic constraints based on shared morphological patterns across dialects.

The methodology consists of three main components:
1. A base morphological analyzer trained on standard Turkish
2. A transfer learning framework for adaptation to dialectal variants
3. A constraint-based post-processing system that enforces linguistic rules

## Results

Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms baseline methods when applied to three low-resource Turkish dialects. The transfer learning component provides a 12% improvement in accuracy over training directly on dialectal data, while the linguistic constraints add an additional 5% improvement.

| Model | Karadeniz Dialect | Central Anatolian Dialect | Southeastern Dialect |
|-------|-------------------|---------------------------|----------------------|
| Baseline | 67.3% | 71.2% | 65.8% |
| Transfer Learning | 79.1% | 83.5% | 77.9% |
| TL + Constraints | 84.2% | 88.7% | 82.6% |

## Conclusion

This thesis demonstrates the effectiveness of combining transfer learning with linguistic knowledge for morphological analysis of low-resource Turkish dialects. The results suggest that this approach can be extended to other Turkic languages and potentially to other morphologically rich language families facing similar resource constraints.
