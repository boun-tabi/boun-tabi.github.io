# Neural Approaches to Turkish Question Answering Systems

## Abstract

This thesis explores novel neural network architectures for question answering in Turkish, addressing the challenges posed by the language's morphological complexity. We propose a new architecture that incorporates morphological analysis into the encoding process, significantly improving performance on Turkish QA tasks.

## Introduction

Question Answering (QA) systems have seen remarkable progress in recent years, largely due to advances in deep learning and the availability of large-scale datasets. However, most of this progress has been concentrated on high-resource languages like English. Languages with rich morphology, such as Turkish, present unique challenges for QA systems.

This thesis addresses these challenges by developing neural architectures specifically designed to handle the morphological complexity of Turkish. We explore how incorporating morphological information can improve the performance of QA systems for Turkish.

## Methodology

Our approach consists of three main components:

1. A morphological analyzer for Turkish
2. A modified transformer architecture that incorporates morphological features
3. A novel attention mechanism that attends to both word-level and morpheme-level representations

We evaluate our approach on a new Turkish QA dataset that we collected and annotated as part of this thesis.

## Results

Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements over previous state-of-the-art methods:

| Model | Exact Match | F1 Score |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| Baseline BERT | 45.2% | 58.7% |
| mBERT | 52.3% | 64.1% |
| Our Model | 61.8% | 73.5% |

## Conclusion

The results demonstrate that explicitly modeling morphological information can substantially improve question answering performance for Turkish. Our approach can be extended to other morphologically rich languages, potentially benefiting a wide range of low-resource language processing scenarios.
