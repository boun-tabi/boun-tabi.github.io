                                <p>Scientific publications are the main media through which researchers report their new
                                    findings. The huge amount and the continuing rapid growth of the number of published
                                    articles in biomedicine, has made it particularly difficult for researchers to
                                    access and utilize the knowledge contained in them. Currently, there are over 21
                                    million publications indexed in PubMed, which is the main system that provides
                                    access to the biomedical literature. Over 2000 new entries are added to the system
                                    every day. Developing text mining techniques to automatically extract biologically
                                    important information such as relationships between biomolecules is not only useful,
                                    but also necessary to facilitate biomedical research and to speed-up scientific
                                    progress. Most of the prior studies in the biomedical text mining field tackle the
                                    problem of extracting the fact that there is a relationship between a pair of
                                    biomolecules. However, for extracted information to make sense, a great deal of
                                    biological context is required. While some of this context such as relationship type
                                    and directionality is found in the sentence that actually reports the relationship,
                                    some of it such as species and experimental method is likely stated elsewhere in the
                                    article. The goal of the proposed project is to design methods based on natural
                                    language processing and machine learning to extract relationships among biomolecules
                                    and their local (sentence-level) and non-local (document-level) context information,
                                    as well as to design novel knowledge discovery methods that utilize the extracted
                                    contextual information.</p>

                            <p>Concept mining can simply be described as a kind of data mining that extracts
                                concepts from events. Concept mining on text documents aims at converting terms into
                                concepts and analyzing these concepts. Usually it is not possible to identify the
                                concepts directly that appear in a document, since the concepts are a kind of
                                meta-data for a document. Thus, it is necessary to determine the term-concept
                                matchings. For this purpose, concept dictionaries and thesauri that involve
                                relationships between the terms are used. During the matching process, it is
                                possible that a single term can correspond to more than one concept or several words
                                can define a single concept. This ambiguous relationship between terms and concepts
                                can be resolved using the context. Meanwhile, the relationships between the concepts
                                and the context are tried to be extracted using semantic similarity.</p>


                            <p>The main stage in concept mining is concept extraction. There are basically two
                                approaches in concept extraction: expert-based approach and statistical approach.
                                The first one is also called rule-based or information engineering-based approach.
                                These systems include a set of pattern matching rules compiled by experts in the
                                field. Such systems can be developed by experts having sufficient knowledge and
                                experience in the field. The main disadvantages of this method are finding such
                                experts and dependence of the system to a particular domain. The second one,
                                statistical approach, is also known as automatic learning approach. It makes use of
                                statistical information gathered from available corpora for learning. Mostly HMM
                                (Hidden Markov Model) is used for this purpose. The transition probabilities are
                                estimated from the training data. The advantage of this approach is the portability
                                of the domain. The disadvantages are the difficulty and cost of building corpora,
                                the need to retrain the system for different concepts, and slower execution.</p>


                            <p>Concept mining studies aim at obtaining efficient solutions to some problems which
                                are harder to solve using data mining. Extracting concepts from documents has the
                                potential of contributing to several applications including new generation search
                                engines. By concept-based searching, the users will be able to obtain more accurate
                                and more extensive search results easily. Some search engines like Google and Yahoo
                                have already initiated concept-based searching research.</p>


                            <p>Our goal in this project is to develop a concept mining application that enables
                                automatic concept extraction from Turkish documents and that performs concept-based
                                text mining. Since it is more appropriate for our purpose, we chose the statistical
                                approach. Although there exist some studies for extracting concepts from documents
                                in English and some other languages, this type of a work has not been performed for
                                Turkish before. In the scope of this work which will be a pioneering work for
                                Turkish, all the functionalities that exist in concept mining studies in other
                                languages will be fulfilled. However, during these studies, the methods and products
                                developed in other systems will not be imitated, instead new methods and a new
                                product that are original and that have a research value will be formed by taking
                                into account the characteristics of the Turkish language. The system will work as
                                follows: First, terms (noun words and noun phrases) will be extracted from the
                                documents, then sub-dictionary groups will be formed by clustering similar terms,
                                then these sub-dictionaries will be labeled semi-automatically (by an algorithm and
                                by the control of an expert) to determine the concepts and the sub-dictionaries will
                                be recorded in a database with their labels, and finally data mining techniques will
                                be applied to these concepts. For extracting words from documents, analyzing these
                                words, and disambiguating them, the morphological parser and the morphological
                                disambiguator developed in the scope of Boğaziçi University BAP 08M103 and TÜBİTAK
                                107E261 projects will be used. The cosine similarity metric will be employed for
                                discovering term similarities. To group similar terms, we will use k-means or a
                                related clustering approach, and the clusters will be labeled. In this way,
                                word-concept matching will be obtained. The concept extraction phase will be
                                completed after labeling. Finally, some interesting information will be obtained
                                from the concepts by employing data mining methods.</p>

                            <p>Concept extraction is a subtopic of concept mining, which forms an important branch
                                of data mining. Concept mining can be defined as the study of extracting important
                                concepts that appear in documents. A basic point in concept mining is processing the
                                words for obtaining the concepts. Usually thesauri is used during this process.
                                Word-concept matching is usually ambiguous and context is used to resolve the
                                ambiguity. The relationships between the concepts and the context are extracted
                                using semantic similarity. Also, formal concept analysis that makes this
                                relationship explicit is another important topic. Concept extraction study aims at
                                obtaining efficient solutions to some problems which are harder to solve using data
                                mining. </p>


                            <p>The two basic approaches in concept extraction can be named as expert-based approach
                                and statistical approach. The first one is also called rule-based or information
                                engineering-based approach. These systems include a set of pattern matching rules
                                compiled by experts in the field. The main disadvantage of this method is finding
                                such experts. The second one, statistical approach, is also known as automatic
                                learning approach. It makes use of statistical informations gathered from available
                                corpora for learning. Mostly HMM (Hidden Markov Model) is used for this purpose. The
                                transition probabilities are estimated from the training data. The advantage is
                                portability of the domain. The disadvantages are the difficulty and cost of building
                                corpora, the need to retrain the system for different concepts, and slower
                                execution.</p>


                            <p>Our goal in this project is to build an automated concept extraction system for
                                Turkish. Since it is more appropriate for the model we build, we will use
                                statistical approach rather than the expert-based approach. The PASW software
                                developed by SPSS for data mining is a successful concept extraction application for
                                English and other well-known languages. In this project, we aim at implementing the
                                works done by PASW Text Analytics module for Turkish. The system will work as
                                follows: First, noun words will be extracted from the documents, then sub-dictionary
                                groups will be formed by clustering similar words, then these sub-dictionaries will
                                be labeled manually, and finally data mining techniques will be applied to these
                                concepts. For extracting words from documents and disambiguating these words, the
                                morphological parser and the morphological disambiguator developed in the scope of
                                Bogaziçi University BAP 08M103 and TÜBITAK 107E261 projects will be used. The cosine
                                similarity metric will be employed for discovering tem similarities. To group
                                similar terms, we will use k-means or a related clustering approach, and the terms
                                will be labeled manually. In this way, word-concept matching will be obtained. The
                                concept extraction phase will be completed after labeling. Finally, some interesting
                                information will be obtained from the concepts by employing data mining methods.</p>

                            <p>In this project, our aim is to develop a large vocabulary continuous speech
                                recognition system for Turkish. The state-of-art speech recognition systems are
                                basically composed of three main systems. These are acoustic model, language model,
                                and speech decoder. </p>


                            <p>Acoustic model: This model is used to calculate the probability of an acoustic
                                feature vector sequence. Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are widely used for training an
                                acoustic model using a speech corpus. For this purpose there are many available
                                software packages such as HTK and the acoustic model training is not different for
                                Turkish. Building an acoustic model for Turkish is not a contribution of this
                                project, however it is required for all speech recognition systems. For training
                                acoustic models, we plan to use the news speech recordings of about 200 hours that
                                the project researcher Murat Saraçlar has compiled. The recordings have been
                                transcribed. </p>


                            <p>Language model: This model is used to estimate the probability of a word sequence.
                                N-gram language models have been successfully used for languages like English.
                                Researches have found that these N-gram word models are not as successfull for
                                agglutinative languages like Turkish. Therefore, it is an active research area to
                                build language models for morphologically complex languages like Turkish, Finnish,
                                and Arabic. The most important contribution of this project is to construct a
                                language model for Turkish that takes into account morphological linguistic
                                structure of the words. The language resources that we developed for this purpose
                                are: </p>

                            <ul>
                                <li><p>Morphological Parser: The importance of this parser is that it is the first
                                    system as far as we know that is based on finite-state machines and is not
                                    dependent on any other external system such as PC-Kimmo. In this project to
                                    develop a real-time speech recognition engine, the efficiency of finite-state
                                    machines and the independence from other systems are very important
                                    factors. </p></li>
                                <li><p>Morphological Disambiguation: Morphological parser may return more than one
                                    possible analysis for a Turkish word. Chosing the correct analysis for the word
                                    in a given context is required to build a morphology-based language model. The
                                    system that we developed has the best accuracy reported so far.</p></li>
                                <li><p>Turkish Web Corpus: One of the problems that we face in training a language
                                    model for Turkish is the lack of a large text corpus. The existing corpora are
                                    very small or very unclean larger web text. Researchers have found that very
                                    large corpus is better than small clean corpus even if it is noisy. In this
                                    project, we have compiled a fairly clean web corpus of about 430 million
                                    words. </p></li>
                            </ul>


                            <p>We aim to build an effective language model for Turkish using these resources. We
                                have seen the importance of using the morphological structure of the words in our
                                previous works. For this purpose, we plan to parse the web corpus using the
                                morphological parser and then to disambiguate these parses using our morphological
                                disambiguation system and use the morpheme statistics to train a statistical model
                                for Turkish. We will convert the morphological parser to a probabilistic one giving
                                the probability of an analysis also. We are aware of the fact that the language
                                model may need to be designed with the speech decoder. Therefore we aim to design a
                                speech decoder that can work with the morphology-based language model. </p>


                            <p>Speech Decoder: Due to complex morphology of Turkish, in our experiments we have seen
                                that using a morphology-based static language model with a standard speech decoder
                                is not feasible. In this project, we aim to develop a speech decoder that uses the
                                morphotactics of the Turkish. So that, we will be able to limit the morphemes that
                                may be suffixed to a word and estimate the probabilities using our morphology-basd
                                language model. We will design the speech decoder that can run in real time. </p>


                            <p>In summary, the contributions of this project is as follows: </p>

                                <li><p>A real-time speech decoder system for Turkish. The available outputs and the
                                    first experimental results that we obtained in this project are very promising.
                                    The Turkish language resources that we developed are very important for academic
                                    research in this area. We have already shared some of these resources with
                                    researchers. Developing a high accuracy speech recognition system for Turkish is
                                    vital. Some application areas of a speech recognition system are man-machine
                                    interaction such as dictation, broadcast news transcription, and word spotting
                                    in telephone recordings for national security. The language resources that we
                                    compiled are very important for computer processing of Turkish language. Also
                                    the development of a high accuracy speech recognition system is very important
                                    for our language.</p></li>

                            <p>In this project, we aimed at developing a high performance large vocabulary
                                continuous speech recognition system for Turkish. The most important contribution of
                                this work has been to develop a morphology-based language model for Turkish. As a
                                result of our previous work, we have built some language resources for Turkish such
                                as a morphological parser, a morphological disambiguator, and a web corpus. Using
                                these language resources, in this project, we developed an effective
                                morphology-based language model for Turkish. We also replaced the static lexicon
                                with a dynamic one based on the morphological parser. So that, we greatly alleviated
                                the out-of-vocabulary problem for Turkish. We also developed a speech decoder which
                                can do speech decoding on morphology-integrated search networks. </p>

                                mevcuttur. Fakat, bu çalışmaların başarı oranı belli bir sınırı geçememektedir.
                                Bunun başlıca sebebi, hemen hemen bütün çalışmalarda, sadece sentaktik (sözdizimsel

                            <p>Bu projede, Türkçe gibi eklemeli dillerde geniş sözcük dağarcıklı sürekli konuşma
                                tanıma (large vocabulary continuous speech recognition LVCSR) sistemleri için
                                kullanılacak yeni bir dil modelinin geliştirilmesi amaçlanmaktadır. Bilindiği gibi,
                                eklemeli dillerde sınırsız sayıda kelime üretilebilmesi, konuşma tanıma
                                sistemlerinde dil modeli oluşturmada zorluklara neden olmaktadır ve iyi bir dil
                                modelinin eksikliği bu sistemlerin etkinliğini önemli ölçüde etkilemektedir.
                                İngilizce gibi nispeten eklemeli olmayan dillerde konuşma tanıma sistemlerinin
                                başarıyla geliştirilmiş olmasının ve Türkçe gibi dillerde henüz aynı başarıya
                                ulaşılamamasının en önemli nedenlerinden birisi, etkin bir dil modelinin
                                eksikliğidir. Konuşma tanıma sistemlerinde yaygın olarak n-birimli (n-gram) dil
                                modeli kullanılmaktadır. Bu model, dili istatistiki olarak modellemeye
                                çalışmaktadır. Geniş bir metin havuzundan (corpus) sözcüklerin birbiri ardına gelme
                                sıklıklarını göz önüne alarak oluşturulan model, sözcük dizilerinin olasılıklarını
                                hesaplamakta kullanılmaktadır. Türkçe&#39;de diğer bir sorun, sözcüklerin cümle
                                içinde diziliminin nispeten serbest olmasıdır. Bu serbestlik sorunu Türkçe&#39;nin
                                eklemeli bir dil olması ile birleştiğinde, sözcük bazında basit bir n-birimli dil
                                modelinin konuşma tanıma sistemlerinde etkinliğini azaltmaktadır. Bu çalışma ile
                                Türkçe&#39;nin morfotaktik (morphotactic) (morfların dizilim kuralları) bilgisini
                                n-birimli bir dil modeli ile birleştirerek etkin bir dil modelinin oluşturulması
                                hedeflenmektedir. Böylece Türkçe için birçok uygulama alanına sahip geniş sözcük
                                dağarcıklı konuşma tanıma sistemleri geliştirilebilecektir.</p>
